var x;

console.log(z);

var k = Infinity;
var m = undefined;
var p = null;
console.log(k);
console.log(m);
console.log(p);

// Infinity ==> In js there is something called as infinity and undefined.
// Application crash nahi hui.

// y and z not declared as var but still working because assign kiya.
// But as a good practice we should always declare var.
