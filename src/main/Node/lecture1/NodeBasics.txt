Node is an interpreter.

Interpreter takes some code as input, will compile but will not produce it anywhere and then will exceute it.

Interpreter has just in time compiler.

Jb JS aaya tb sirf browser pe chal skta tha but now it can be run independently as well with the help of interpreter.
So now server side programming (after submitting some form from browser backend code can be written in JS also) 
can also be done with JS.
