Default constructor (if we don't pass anything while creating object)
Parameterized constructor


If we haven't written any constructor then compiler will introduce default one. But if we have written the parameterized constructor
then compiler will not introduce default constructor and comilation will fail if Bulb b = new Bulb();

What we pass in fuction is called argument.
What we receive in function is called parameter.
